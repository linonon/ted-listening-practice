# What frogs in hot water can teach us about thinking again

You might have heard ~~about~~ that if you drop a frog in a pot of `boiling` water, it will jump out right away, but if you put it in `lukewarm` water, and ~~then~~ slowly heat it up, the frog won't survive.
The frog's **big** problem is that ~~it's~~ it lack**s** of the ability of rethink **the** situation.
It doesn't realize **that** the warm bath is becoming a death trap -- until it's too late.

> boiling:  沸腾的
> lukewarm: 温的

Human**s** ~~may~~ might be smarter than ~~the~~ frogs, but our world is full of **slow-** boling pots.
Think about ~~the~~ **how** slow people were **to** reacted to ~~the~~ warnings about a `pandemic`, `climate change` or **a** democracy in ~~pary~~ `peril`.
We fail to ~~reacted to~~ recognize the ~~dangerous~~ danger, because we are `reluctant` to rethink the situation.

> pandemic: 疫情
> democracy: 民主, 政体
> peril: 极大危险
> climate change: 气候变化
> reluctant: 不情愿
