# What frogs in hot water can teach us about thinking again

You might have heard ~~about~~ that if you drop a frog in a pot of `boiling` water, it will jump out right away, but if you put it in `lukewarm` water, and ~~then~~ slowly heat it up, the frog won't survive.
The frog's **big** problem is that ~~it's~~ it lack**s** of the ability of rethink **the** situation.
It doesn't realize **that** the warm bath is becoming a death trap -- until it's too late.

- `boiling`:  沸腾的
- `lukewarm`: 温的

Human**s** ~~may~~ might be smarter than ~~the~~ frogs, but our world is full of **slow-** boiling pots.
Think about ~~the~~ **how** slow people were **to** reacted to ~~the~~ warnings about a `pandemic`, `climate change` or **a** democracy in ~~pary~~ `peril`.
We fail to ~~reacted to~~ recognize the ~~dangerous~~ danger, because we are `reluctant` to rethink the situation.

- `pandemic`: 疫情
- `democracy`: 民主, 政体
- `peril`: 极大危险
- `climate change`: 气候变化
- `reluctant`: 不情愿

We struggle with rethinking ~~with~~ in all kinds of the situations.
We expect our `squeaky` **brakes to keep working**, until ~~we~~ they finally fail **on** ~~our~~ the `freeway`.
We believe the stock market will keep going up, even after we hear a ~~realistic~~ `real-estate` ~~bubbo~~ bubble.
Ane we keep watching "Game of Thrones", even after the show jump**s** ~~off the sharp~~ the shark.

- `squeaky`: 嘎吱作响的
- `brake`: 刹车系统
- `freeway`: 高速公路
- `real-estate`: 房地产
- `jumps the shark`: 开始走下坡路

Rethinking ~~is~~ isn't **a** `hurdle` in every part of our lives.
We are happy to refresh the ~~wordrop~~ `wardrobs` and `renovate` our kitchen.
But when it ~~turn~~ comes to our goal**s**, identit**ies** and habit**s**, ~~it~~ we tend to stick to our guns.
And ~~it~~ in a ~~raply~~ rapidly changing world, that is huge problem.

- `hurdle`: n. 障碍, 栏杆; v. 克服
- `wardrobs`: 衣柜
- `renovate`: 翻新
- `tend to do sth`: 傾向於
- `stick to one's gun`: 坚守阵地, 固执己见

I'm an organizational ~~phycologisy~~ psychologist.
It's my job to rethink how we work, ~~leed~~ lead and live.
But that ~~doesn't stop~~ hasn't stopped me ~~to living~~ from getting stuck in ~~the~~ slow-boiling ~~little~~ pots.
So I started studying why.
I ~~have~~ learned that intelligen**ce** doesn't help us excape; sometimes, ito traps us longer.
Being good at thinking **can** make~~s~~ you worse ~~of~~ at rethinking.
There's evidence ~~said~~ that **the** smarter you are, the more likely **you're** ~~fall back~~ `fall victim` to the "I'm not biased" bias.
You can always find ~~a reason~~ reasons to convince youself that you are on the right path, which is exactly what I and my friend did ~~when we~~ **on a**  trip to Panama.

- `fall victim`: 成为受害者

I work **my way** through ~~my junior year~~ college, and by my junior year, I **had** finally save**d** enough money to travel.
~~It's~~ It was the first time leaving ~~the~~ North Amarica, I was excited for **my first time** climb**ing** ~~up~~ a ~~mounten~~ mountain, actually an active volcano, literally a slow-boiling pot.
I set a goal to reach the `summit`, and ~~looking~~ look into the `crater`.

- `summit`: 山顶
- `crater`: 火山口

So we are in Panama, we get off **to a** late start, but it **is** only **supposed to** take **about** two hours to get to the top.
After four hours, we still ~~hadn't reach~~ haven't reached the top.
It's a little ~~stringe~~ strange that ~~it~~ it's taking so long, but we don't stop to rethink whether we should turn around.
We have already come so far, we have to make it to the top.
Do not stand between me and my goal.
We don't realize, we've read the wrong map.
We are on Panama's highest mountain, it ~~usually~~ actually takes 6 to 8 hours to **`hike` to** the ~~summit~~ top.
By the time we finally reach the summit, the sun is setting.
We are stranded, with no food, no water, no cell phone, and no energy for the hike down.

- `hike`: 徒步旅行, 价格上升

There's a name for this kind of mistake, it's called "`escalation` of commitment to a losing course of action." It happens when you make an initial investment of time or money, and then you find out ~~that~~ it might **have** be**en** a bad choice, but instead of rethinking it, you double down and invest more. You want to prove to yourself and everyone else that you made a good decision. Escalation of commitment explains so many familar **examples of businesses plummeting**.

- `escalation`: 迅速增加

Blockbuster, Blackberry, Kodak. Leaders just kept simmering in their slow-boiling pots, failing to rethink their strategies. Escalation of `commitment` explains why you might have stuck~~ed~~ **around too long** in a miserable jobs, why you've probably wait**ed** for a table way too long at a restaurant and why you **might** have ~~hang~~ hung on **to** a **bad** relationship **long** after your friend**s** ~~tell~~ encourage**d** you to leave.

- `commitment`: 忠诚, 献身

It's hard to admit that we were wrong and that we might have even wasted years of our lives. So we try to tell ourself, "If I try harder, I can turn this around."

We live in a culture that worships at the `altar` of hustle and prays to the high priest of grit. But sometimes, that lead**s** us to keep going when we should ~~rethink~~ stop to think again. Experiment**s** show~~s~~ that grit**t**y people are more lik**e**ly to **over**play ~~higt risk~~their hands in casino games and more likely **to keep trying** to solve impossible puzzles. My colleagues and I have found that NBA basketball coaches who are determined to develop the potential in rookies **keep them around** much longer than their performance justifies.

- `altar`: 祭坛
- `prays to the high priest of grit`: 向最高的勇气牧师祈祷

And researchers have even suggested that the most `tenacious` mountaineers are more likely to die on `expeditions`, because they **are** determined to do whatever it takes to reach the summit.

- `tenacious`: 有毅力的
- `expedition`: 远征, 考察

In Panama, My friends and I got lucky. About an hour **into** our desent, a lone **pickup** truck came down the volcano and rescued us from ~~the~~ **our** slow-boiling pot~~s~~. There is a fine line between heroic presistence and stubb**o**rn stupidity. Sometime**s** the best kind of grit is `gritting your teeth` and `packing your bags`. "Never give up" doesn't mean "keep doing the thing~~s~~ ~~you~~ **that's** failing." It means "Don't get locked in**to** one narrow path.", and stay open to broad**en**ing your goals. The ultimate ~~golds~~**goal** is ~~getting~~ **to make it** down the mountain, not **just** reach the top. Your goals can give you tunnel vision, blinding you to rethink**ing** the situation.

- `grit your teeth`: 咬紧牙关
- `pack your bags`: 知难而退

It's not just ~~the~~goal**s** can ~~give you~~ **cause this kind of** `shortsightedness`, it's your identity too. As a kid, my identity ~~is~~**was wrapped** up ~~my~~ **in** sports. I spent countless ~~time~~ **hours** shooting hoops ~~in~~ **on** my driveway, and then I ~~get~~ **got** cut ~~in~~ **from the middle school** basketball team, all three years.

- `shortsightedness`: 短视
- `be wrapped up in`: 埋头于, 被包藏于
- `driveway`: 车道

I spent **a** decade ~~on~~ **playing** ~~socker~~ **soccer**, but **I** didn't make ~~me to the socker~~ **the high school** team. At that ~~spot~~ **point**, I shifted **my focus to a new** ~~to another~~ sport, diving. I was bad, I walk like **Frankenstein**, I couldn't jump, I could hardly touch my toes **without bending my knees**, and I was ~~afarid~~**afraid** of ~~hight~~**heights**.

But I was determined. I stayed ~~in~~ **at** the pool until **it was** dark, and my coach kicked me out of ~~the~~ pratice. I knew that **the seeds of** greatness are **planted in the daily** `grind`, and eventually, my hard work `paid off`. By the senior year, I made the All-America**n** list, and I ~~qualify~~ **qualified** the ~~jenior olympic national~~ **Junior Olympic Nationals**. I was **obsessed** with diving. It was more something I did, it became who I was. Diving gave me a way to fit in or stand out. I have a team where I belonged and a rare skill to share. I had people rooting for me and control over my progress.

- `daily grind`: 每日的小事
- `paid off`: 得到回报

But when I got to college, the sport that I loved became something I started to dread. At that level, I could not beat more talented drivers by `outworking` them. I was supposed to be doing higher dives, but I was still afarid of heights, and 6am practice was `brutal`.

- `outworking`: 比...努力
- `brutal`: 辛苦

My mind was awake, but my muscles were still sleep. I did back smacks and belly flops and my slow-boiling pot this time was a freezing pool. There was one question, thought, that stopped me from rethinking."If I'm not a diver, who am I?" In psycology, there's a term of this kind of rethinking -- it's called "identity foreclosure." It's when you settle `prematurely` on a sense of who you are and close your mind to alternative selves.

- `prematurely`: 过早地

You **are** probably experienced identity foreclosure. Maybe you were too attached to an early idea of what school you'd go to, what kind of person you'd marry, or what career you'd choose. Foreclosing on one identity is like following **a** GPS that gives you the right directions to the wrong destination. After my fresh year of college, I rethought my identity. I realize that diving ~~is~~ **was** a passion, not a purpose. My values were to grow and excel, and to contribute to helping my teammates grow and excel. Grow, excel, contribute. I didn't have to be a diver to grow, excel and contribute.

Research suggest~~ed~~**s** that instead of foreclosing on one identity, we're better off trying on a range of possible selves. Retiring from diving freed me up to spend the summer doing psychology research and working as a diving coach. It also gave me time to concerntrate on my dorkiest hobby, performing as a magician. I'm still working on my sleight of hand. Open**ing** my mind to new identities opened new doors. Research showed me that I enjoyed creating knowledge, not just consuming it. Coaching and performing helped me see myself as a teacher and an entertainer. If that hadn't happened, I might not have become a psychologist and a professor, and I probably wouldn't be giving this TED talk.

- `be better off doing`: 最好做...

See, I'm an introvert, and when I first started teaching, I was afraid of public speaking. I had a mentor, Jane Dutton, who gave me some `invaluable` advice. She said, "You have to `unleash` your inner magician." So I turned my class into a live show.

- `invaluable`: 极有用的
- `unleash`: 释放出

Before the first day, I memorized my students' names and backgrounds, and then, I mastered my routine.
