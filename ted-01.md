# What frogs in hot water can teach us about thinking again

You might have heard ~~about~~ that if you drop a frog in a pot of `boiling` water, it will jump out right away, but if you put it in `lukewarm` water, and ~~then~~ slowly heat it up, the frog won't survive.
The frog's **big** problem is that ~~it's~~ it lack**s** of the ability of rethink **the** situation.
It doesn't realize **that** the warm bath is becoming a death trap -- until it's too late.

- `boiling`:  沸腾的
- `lukewarm`: 温的

Human**s** ~~may~~ might be smarter than ~~the~~ frogs, but our world is full of **slow-** boiling pots.
Think about ~~the~~ **how** slow people were **to** reacted to ~~the~~ warnings about a `pandemic`, `climate change` or **a** democracy in ~~pary~~ `peril`.
We fail to ~~reacted to~~ recognize the ~~dangerous~~ danger, because we are `reluctant` to rethink the situation.

- `pandemic`: 疫情
- `democracy`: 民主, 政体
- `peril`: 极大危险
- `climate change`: 气候变化
- `reluctant`: 不情愿

We struggle with rethinking ~~with~~ in all kinds of the situations.
We expect our `squeaky` **brakes to keep working**, until ~~we~~ they finally fail **on** ~~our~~ the `freeway`.
We believe the stock market will keep going up, even after we hear a ~~realistic~~ `real-estate` ~~bubbo~~ bubble.
Ane we keep watching "Game of Thrones", even after the show jump**s** ~~off the sharp~~ the shark.

- `squeaky`: 嘎吱作响的
- `brake`: 刹车系统
- `freeway`: 高速公路
- `real-estate`: 房地产
- `jumps the shark`: 开始走下坡路

Rethinking ~~is~~ isn't **a** `hurdle` in every part of our lives.
We are happy to refresh the ~~wordrop~~ `wardrobs` and `renovate` our kitchen.
But when it ~~turn~~ comes to our goal**s**, identit**ies** and habit**s**, ~~it~~ we tend to stick to our guns.
And ~~it~~ in a ~~raply~~ rapidly changing world, that is huge problem.

- `hurdle`: n. 障碍, 栏杆; v. 克服
- `wardrobs`: 衣柜
- `renovate`: 翻新
- `tend to do sth`: 傾向於
- `stick to one's gun`: 坚守阵地, 固执己见

I'm an organizational ~~phycologisy~~ psychologist.
It's my job to rethink how we work, ~~leed~~ lead and live.
But that ~~doesn't stop~~ hasn't stopped me ~~to living~~ from getting stuck in ~~the~~ slow-boiling ~~little~~ pots.
So I started studying why.
I ~~have~~ learned that intelligen**ce** doesn't help us excape; sometimes, ito traps us longer.
Being good at thinking **can** make~~s~~ you worse ~~of~~ at rethinking.
There's evidence ~~said~~ that **the** smarter you are, the more likely **you're** ~~fall back~~ `fall victim` to the "I'm not biased" bias.
You can always find ~~a reason~~ reasons to convince youself that you are on the right path, which is exactly what I and my friend did ~~when we~~ **on a**  trip to Panama.

- `fall victim`: 成为受害者

I work **my way** through ~~my junior year~~ college, and by my junior year, I **had** finally save**d** enough money to travel.
~~It's~~ It was the first time leaving ~~the~~ North Amarica, I was excited for **my first time** climb**ing** ~~up~~ a ~~mounten~~ mountain, actually an active volcano, literally a slow-boiling pot.
I set a goal to reach the `summit`, and ~~looking~~ look into the `crater`.

- `summit`: 山顶
- `crater`: 火山口

So we are in Panama, we get off **to a** late start, but it **is** only **supposed to** take **about** two hours to get to the top.
After four hours, we still ~~hadn't reach~~ haven't reached the top.
It's a little ~~stringe~~ strange that ~~it~~ it's taking so long, but we don't stop to rethink whether we should turn around.
We have already come so far, we have to make it to the top.
Do not stand between me and my goal.
We don't realize, we've read the wrong map.
We are on Panama's highest mountain, it ~~usually~~ actually takes 6 to 8 hours to **`hike` to** the ~~summit~~ top.
By the time we finally reach the summit, the sun is setting.
We are stranded, with no food, no water, no cell phone, and no energy for the hike down.

- `hike`: 徒步旅行, 价格上升
